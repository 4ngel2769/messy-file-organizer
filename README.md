## About

Messy File Organizer is a powerful tool designed to solve the problem of cluttered download folders. It automatically categorizes and organizes files based on their types, keeping your digital workspace clean and efficient.

The application monitors your downloads folder in real-time, detecting new files and sorting them into appropriate category folders based on file extensions. This eliminates the need for manual organization and helps you find files quickly when needed.

Messy File Organizer works on Windows 10 & 11 and Linux systems. Mac support is experimental as it hasn't been extensively tested.
